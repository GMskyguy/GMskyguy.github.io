					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> What I learned from this article is that whitespace is important. But more specifically than than, that consistency in whitespace is important. For example, wayfair always implements whitespace in multiples of 8. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article was when they mentioned the multiples of 8. Most of the time when I design in figma or webflow, I don't really pay attention to the pixels, I just eyeball it. Implementing this practice would make the designs a lot more consistent with the user in mind. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> Users will scroll and scroll some more. I promise you. </p>
						</li>

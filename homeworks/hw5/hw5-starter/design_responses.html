                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I'm not sure if I'm tripping but just to clarify, I'm going based off the animations of the pictures and not words bc there are none. I learned that animations can make the ui be a lot more pleasing. Furthermore, it can draw atention to the important parts of the screen. </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I liked how there were no words, and I could just look at the pretty pictures mmmmm. I really enjoyed seeing all the cool ways that people use animations, especially My Wallet. They used a spinning circle to highlight how much that someone was sending. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> Since I already talked about MyWallet, I'll describe my econd favorite, Awesomed. It isn't the fanciest, but I like it because it seems like something I could do. As you scroll, the text and images also scroll. It seems very doable, and that inspires me to try it because there are some websites that are just too fancy, but this seems like something that I could accomplish. I've tried to do something similar in webflow and failed though. </p>

                            <p> 7, I woulda liked some text because I kinda had to interpret each ui design and what it accomplished for myself.</p>

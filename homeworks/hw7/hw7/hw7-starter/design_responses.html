						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I had no clue how many possibilities there were to show continuity and relationships in web design. I also thought it was cool that you can apply visual/art design and heiarchy into web design. I really liked the section about flow, and how our eyes tend to take the path of leaset resistance.   </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I liked the part of the article that talked about continuation and flow. I feel like symetry and whatnot makes sense and is pretty intuitive. Flow and continuity is something I've never considered, so being introduced to this in the article was awesome. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> Continuity helps us interpret direction and movement through a composition. </p>
						</li>

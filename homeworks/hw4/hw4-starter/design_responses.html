					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I had no clue that there were actual regulations for color on websites. It'vs very interesting to me because while I make everything easy to read because it looks better, I didn't know that there were actual regulations against that. I also didn;t know that there were actual ratios for the contrast of colors.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was when they talked about al the different ways to utilize color to make your website more accessible. But even more than that, I liked it when he showed visual ways to display erros outside of color. I also liked how he showed visual ways to display color to color blind people. Accomodating for colorblindess is something I've never considered.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> You can also ensure accessibility by making sure you donâ€™t rely on color to relay crucial system information.  </p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p> Maybe a 4 tbh. Even though I had no idea we had to do things to make the website more accessible, I feel like I do those things anyway out of common sense.  </p>
